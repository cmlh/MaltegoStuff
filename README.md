# Klout influencer/influencee transforms

There are many things to examine in terms of relationships between Twitter accounts. I very rarely feel the need to consult Klout influencer/influencee connections, but this is something I often do when presented with a new group to examine, so long as they are above board influences of topics of public debate.

Start with a list of notable Twitter accounts and work through either either the influencer or influencee transform in batches of six to eight. Not all accounts are registered for Klout, and despite how simple these transforms are they will mysteriously fail for one or two accounts in each batch which do have Klout profiles. Iteration is key until you have identified all accounts that do NOT have a Klout profile.

It would not be unusual to start with a list of a hundred accounts involved in political debate for a given state and find no overlap in influencees and little overlap in influencers, except for a few big names. A small community may reveal itself in one iteration, but two to four rounds of expanding search are typically needed.

Use color tags liberally in your analysis, especially if mixing influencers and influencees. Tagging initial subjects red, first order influencees orange, second order yellow, and so forth may produce a graph that yields some insight. Counting on degree to ID important accounts will be less effective than you might expect.

When digging through a lot of ASes I kept finding myself Googling them and ending up on their respective Hurricane Electric pages. This really should be a default included IN the AS entity for Maltego
